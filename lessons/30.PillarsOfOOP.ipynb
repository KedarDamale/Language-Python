    "### üí° 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a **programming paradigm** based on the concept of **\"objects\"**, which encapsulate both **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods/functions). OOP models real-world entities as objects to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Pillars of OOP**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods together.\n",
    "* **Abstraction**: Hiding internal implementation details.\n",
    "* **Inheritance**: Reusing code from parent/superclasses.\n",
    "* **Polymorphism**: One interface, many implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.brand} is starting.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
    "car1.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì¶ 2. **Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "A **class** is a **blueprint or template** for creating objects. It defines **what attributes (variables)** and **methods (functions)** the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Insight**:\n",
    "When a class is created, Python stores it in memory as a `class object`. When you instantiate it, Python creates a separate `instance object` with its own `__dict__` to store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî∏ 3. **Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "An **object** is an **instance of a class**. It has a specific identity, state (data), and behavior (methods). While a class defines **what**, an object represents **how** it behaves in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stored as a memory block with an internal `__dict__`.\n",
    "* Methods are bound to the object at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Rocky\")\n",
    "dog1.bark()  # Output: Rocky says Woof!\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### üß¨ 4. **Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "**Inheritance** allows a class (called **child/subclass**) to inherit **attributes and methods** from another class (called **parent/superclass**), promoting **code reuse** and a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single Inheritance**: One parent, one child.\n",
    "* **Multiple Inheritance**: Multiple parents.\n",
    "* **Multilevel Inheritance**: Inheriting from a derived class.\n",
    "* **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses of one parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal moves\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "d = Dog()\n",

    "\n",
    "### üîí 5. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and **restricting access** to some components to protect internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Implementation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public: `self.name`\n",
    "* Protected: `self._name` (by convention)\n",
    "* Private: `self.__name` (name mangled)\n",

    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protects object integrity\n",
    "* Prevents unintended interference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # private\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üé≠ 6. **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "**Abstraction** means showing only **essential features** and hiding the **complex internal logic**. It allows the user to interact with the object without needing to understand the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python**:\n",
    "Achieved via **abstract classes** or **interfaces** using the `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",

    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, r):\n",
    "        self.r = r\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß© 7. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "**Polymorphism** means \"many forms\". It allows methods to have **different behavior** depending on the object calling them, even if they share the **same name**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compile-time (Overloading)**: Not natively supported in Python.\n",
    "* **Run-time (Overriding)**: Common in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example ‚Äì Method Overriding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Some generic bird sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Chirp chirp\")\n",

    "### ‚öôÔ∏è 8. **Constructor (`__init__`) and Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "A **constructor** is a special method (`__init__`) that gets called **automatically when an object is created**. It is used to **initialize** object properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Default constructor**: No parameters except `self`.\n",
    "* **Parameterized constructor**: Accepts parameters to initialize object.\n",
    "* **Copy constructor**: Not built-in in Python (manually done).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name=\"Unknown\"):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "### üß† 9. **`self` and `cls` pointers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîπ `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "`self` is a **reference to the current object** (instance) of the class. It must be the **first parameter** of any instance method and is **automatically passed** by Python when you call a method on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of `self` as a pointer to the object's memory block.**\n",

    "#### üîπ `cls`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "`cls` is used in **class methods** (decorated with `@classmethod`) to refer to the **class itself**, not the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is similar to `self`, but points to the **class object**, not instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    wheels = 4\n",
