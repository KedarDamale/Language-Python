    "### ‚úÖ **1. Encapsulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit ‚Äî called a **class**. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a way of **protecting the internal state** of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevents external interference and misuse.\n",
    "* Achieved using **access modifiers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `public`: accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "  * `protected` (`_` prefix): should not be accessed outside the class, but technically possible.\n",
    "  * `private` (`__` prefix): restricts access; not directly accessible from outside.\n",
    "* Uses **getter and setter methods** to control access and modification of private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy:**\n",
    "Think of a **capsule pill** ‚Äî you only see the outer cover and get the intended effect. You don't see or access the internal chemicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improves security.\n",
    "* Promotes modular code.\n",
    "* Makes maintenance and debugging easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **2. Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of **hiding complex implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of an object or process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces programming complexity.\n",
    "* Focuses on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.\n",
    "* Achieved through:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "  * Hiding method implementations behind clean interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy:**\n",
    "Consider a **car**: you use the steering, brake, and accelerator to drive ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to understand how the engine, fuel system, or electronics work internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Helps manage large and complex systems.\n",
    "* Encourages clean and organized APIs.\n",
    "* Promotes focus on high-level design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **3. Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (**child/subclass**) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and variables) of another class (**parent/superclass**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables **code reusability** and **hierarchical classification**.\n",
    "* Types of Inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Single Inheritance:** One child, one parent.\n",
    "  * **Multiple Inheritance:** One child, multiple parents.\n",
    "  * **Multilevel Inheritance:** Chain of inheritance (Grandparent ‚Üí Parent ‚Üí Child).\n",
    "  * **Hierarchical Inheritance:** One parent, many children.\n",
    "  * **Hybrid Inheritance:** Combination of multiple types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy:**\n",
    "A **child inherits traits from their parents**, such as eye color, height, or behavior ‚Äî similarly, a subclass can inherit attributes and methods from its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eliminates redundancy.\n",
    "* Promotes DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principles.\n",
    "* Supports modular and organized codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **4. Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Polymorphism means ‚Äú**many forms**.‚Äù It allows the **same interface** or method to behave **differently** based on the context or object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Promotes **flexibility** and **interchangeability** of objects.\n",
    "* Two main types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Compile-time polymorphism (Overloading)** ‚Äì not natively supported in traditional sense.\n",
    "  * **Run-time polymorphism (Overriding)** ‚Äì a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "* Also enabled via **duck typing** ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it‚Äôs a duck.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy:**\n",
    "The word ‚Äú**run**‚Äù has different meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Athletes run (physical action)\n",
    "* A machine runs (operates)\n",
    "* You run a program (execute)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supports generalization and abstraction.\n",
    "* Makes code more extensible and maintainable.\n",
    "* Allows different classes to be used interchangeably as long as they implement the same methods.\n",
