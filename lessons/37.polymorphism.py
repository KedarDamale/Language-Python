# üß† Polymorphism in Python - FULL DETAILED DEMO
# ================================================

# Polymorphism literally means "many forms".
# In programming, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
# You can call the same method (e.g., area(), draw(), add()) on different types of objects,
# and they will behave differently depending on the actual class of the object.

# ‚úÖ Why is this powerful?
# You can write **generic**, reusable code that works across different object types
# without knowing their specific class in advance.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# üì¶ Base class - acts like a blueprint for all shape types
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, color, dimension):
        self.color = color           # All shapes will have a color (string)
        self.dimension = dimension   # All shapes will have a dimension (e.g. "2D", "3D")

    def area(self):
        # This is a placeholder method meant to be overridden in subclasses.
        print("Generic area - should be overridden by child classes")


# ------------------------------------------------------
# üü† Circle class inherits from Shape and overrides area()
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, color, dimension, radius):
        super().__init__(color, dimension)  # Call the parent class (Shape) constructor
        self.radius = radius                # Circle-specific attribute

    def area(self):
        # Overridden area method specific to Circle
        print(f"üîµ Area of the circle is: {3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)}")


# ------------------------------------------------------
# üî∫ Triangle class inherits from Shape and overrides area()
class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, color, dimension, side):
        super().__init__(color, dimension)
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        # Overridden area method specific to Triangle
        print(f"üî∫ Area of the triangle is: {0.5 * self.side * self.side}")


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# ‚úÖ Real-world polymorphism: same method name, different behavior

# Creating a list of different shapes
shape_list = [
    Circle("Red", "2D", 5),       # A Circle object
    Triangle("Yellow", "2D", 12)  # A Triangle object
]
#creating list is not necessary to achieve polymorphism its just another way of creating objects without naming each one of them and can be accessed via list indexing or a for loop 

# This prints something like: <__main__.Circle object at 0x000002...>
# Because you're printing an object directly, and there's no __str__() method.
print(shape_list[0])

# Accessing attributes directly
print(shape_list[0].color)  # Red

# The power of polymorphism:
# We can loop through different objects and call the same method: area()
for shape in shape_list:
    # Python dynamically figures out which version of area() to call.
    # This is called **dynamic dispatch** or **runtime polymorphism**.
    shape.area()

# =====================================================
# üî• Duck Typing in Python
# =====================================================

# Duck Typing is based on the philosophy:
# "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
# In Python, we care more about behavior (methods/attributes) than actual types.

# Below classes are completely unrelated ‚Äî no inheritance at all.

class Artist:
    def draw(self):
        print("üé® Artist draws a painting")

class Architect:
    def draw(self):
        print("üìê Architect draws a blueprint")

class Developer:
    def draw(self):
        print("üßë‚Äçüíª Developer draws a flowchart")

# Now imagine a function that doesn't care "who" is drawing.
# It just expects that the object passed to it has a draw() method.
def start_drawing(person):
    # As long as the object passed in has a .draw() method, it works
    person.draw()

# Each of these is a different class, yet all support the same interface: draw()
start_drawing(Artist())     # üé® Artist draws a painting
start_drawing(Architect())  # üìê Architect draws a blueprint
start_drawing(Developer())  # üßë‚Äçüíª Developer draws a flowchart

# No base class, no inheritance ‚Äî just behavior-based polymorphism (Duck Typing)

# =====================================================
# ‚ûï Operator Overloading in Python
# =====================================================

# Operator Overloading lets you redefine how operators like +, *, == work for custom objects

class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # __add__ is the dunder method (magic method) for +
    def __add__(self, other):#self and other are not keywords you can use s and r or anything other
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    # String representation to print vectors nicely
    def __str__(self):
        return f"üìç Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(5, 7)

# This internally calls v1.__add__(v2)
v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3)  # üìç Vector(7, 10)

# Without operator overloading, the + operator would throw a TypeError


#python does not support method overloading as in c++ or java (same method name different number of parameters), it just selects the method that is last declared basically

class Demo:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello!")

    def greet(self, name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Try calling the no-argument greet
d = Demo()
d.greet()

# ‚ùóOutput: Hello, <name>!
# The first greet() is overwritten by the second one.
# So d.greet() will throw a TypeError: missing 1 required positional argument


#although it can be simulated by *args and **kwargs

# ========================================================
# üß† METHOD OVERLOADING in PYTHON (Simulated)
# ========================================================

# Traditional method overloading (like in Java/C++) doesn't work in Python
# because Python does not support multiple methods with the same name
# but different signatures.

# But we can simulate method overloading using:
# 1. Default arguments
# 2. *args and **kwargs (arbitrary positional and keyword arguments)

class Calculator:
    
    # This method behaves differently based on number of arguments
    def add(self, *args):
        # *args allows us to pass a variable number of arguments
        # Internally, args is treated as a tuple of all passed values

        if len(args) == 0:
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è No values to add.")
        elif len(args) == 1:
            print(f"üßÆ Only one value: {args[0]}")
        else:
            total = sum(args)
            print(f"üßÆ Sum of all values: {total}")

# Creating object
calc = Calculator()

# Now trying different 'overloads'
calc.add()             # ‚ö†Ô∏è No values to add.
calc.add(5)            # üßÆ Only one value: 5
calc.add(5, 10)        # üßÆ Sum of all values: 15
calc.add(1, 2, 3, 4)   # üßÆ Sum of all values: 10

"""
Alright Kedar, let's get **technical and precise** about polymorphism in Python, covering these three aspects:

* **Function Polymorphism**
* **Class Polymorphism**
* **Inheritance Polymorphism**

---

# 1. **What is Polymorphism?**

**Polymorphism** means "many forms." In programming, it allows entities like functions or objects to take multiple forms depending on context.

In Python, polymorphism allows the **same interface or function name** to work with different data types or classes.

---

# 2. **Function Polymorphism (also called Function Overloading in other languages)**

Python **does NOT support traditional function overloading** (like in C++/Java, where multiple functions share the same name but differ by parameters).

However, Python achieves polymorphism in functions by:

* **Duck Typing:** Functions accept arguments of any type, and behavior depends on the methods/properties those objects have.

Example:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 10))        # 15 (integer addition)
print(add("hello ", "world"))  # "hello world" (string concatenation)
print(add([1, 2], [3]))  # [1, 2, 3] (list concatenation)
```

Here, `add` is polymorphic: it works on different types because they all support the `+` operator.

---

### Simulating function overloading with default arguments or type checking:

```python
def greet(name=None):
    if name is None:
        print("Hello!")
    else:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet()         # Hello!
greet("Kedar")  # Hello, Kedar!
```

---

# 3. **Class Polymorphism**

Class polymorphism is about **different classes providing the same method names**, so code can interact with objects of different classes through a common interface.

This is often called **"Duck Typing"** or **"Interface Polymorphism"** in Python.

Example:

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

def animal_speak(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

animal_speak(dog)  # Woof!
animal_speak(cat)  # Meow!
```

Here, the function `animal_speak` doesn't care about the class type; it just expects an object with a `speak()` method.

---

# 4. **Inheritance Polymorphism (Subtype Polymorphism)**

This is classic polymorphism via **inheritance** ‚Äî where a subclass **overrides** a method of its parent class, and the overridden method is called depending on the object's actual class.

Example:

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some generic sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

def animal_speak(animal: Animal):
    print(animal.speak())

a = Animal()
d = Dog()
c = Cat()

animal_speak(a)  # Some generic sound
animal_speak(d)  # Woof!
animal_speak(c)  # Meow!
```

* `animal_speak` accepts any `Animal` (or subclass).
* The method called depends on the actual object's class (`Dog` or `Cat`).

This is the essence of **runtime polymorphism**.

---

# 5. **Summary**

| Polymorphism Type        | Description                                               | Example                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Function Polymorphism    | Same function name works on different types (duck typing) | `add(1,2)`, `add("a","b")`                       |
| Class Polymorphism       | Different classes have same method signature              | `Dog.speak()`, `Cat.speak()`                     |
| Inheritance Polymorphism | Subclasses override methods of base class                 | `Dog(Animal).speak()` overrides `Animal.speak()` |

---

# 6. **Additional Notes**

* Python uses **dynamic typing and duck typing**, so polymorphism is **implicit and flexible**.
* No need for explicit interfaces ‚Äî just method name and signature matching is sufficient.
* Polymorphism allows **code reuse**, **extensibility**, and **clean design**.

---

If you want, I can provide:

* Code showing polymorphism in action with abstract base classes (`abc` module).
* Detailed examples of method overriding, `super()`, and polymorphism with multiple inheritance.
* Explanation of **operator overloading** as a kind of polymorphism.

Want me to go deeper on any of these?
