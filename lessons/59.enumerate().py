"""
Alright, here’s a detailed, technical explanation of Python’s `enumerate()` function — what it does, its arguments, internal working, and use cases.

# `enumerate()` Function in Python — Detailed Explanation

`enumerate()` is a built-in Python function that **adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object**. This is commonly used when you need both the **index (position)** and the **value** while iterating over a sequence.

---

## 1. Signature

```python
enumerate(iterable, start=0)
```

Where:

* `iterable`: Any iterable (list, tuple, string, generator, etc.) to be enumerated.
* `start` (optional): Integer value specifying the starting index. Default is `0`.

---

## 2. What does `enumerate()` do?

* Takes an iterable.
* Returns an **enumerate object**, which is an **iterator**.
* When iterated, it yields pairs `(index, element)` where:

  * `index` starts from `start` and increments by 1 each iteration.
  * `element` is the corresponding item from the iterable.
* Provides a convenient way to get a counter/index alongside each element in loops.

---

## 3. Example usage

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)

# Output:
# 0 apple
# 1 banana
# 2 cherry
```

Using a custom start index:

```python
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(i, fruit)

# Output:
# 1 apple
# 2 banana
# 3 cherry
```

---

## 4. How does `enumerate()` work internally?

* `enumerate()` returns an iterator object.
* The iterator keeps track of two things:

  * The current index (starts at `start`).
  * The underlying iterable’s iterator.
* Each call to `next()` on the enumerate iterator:

  * Calls `next()` on the underlying iterable iterator to get the next element.
  * Returns a tuple `(current_index, element)`.
  * Increments the index by 1.

---

## 5. Important details

* The enumerate object is **lazy**, i.e., it doesn’t create a list in memory — values are generated on demand.
* Works with any iterable — including infinite generators.
* The index can start at any integer (positive, zero, or even negative).
* Commonly used in `for` loops, unpacking the `(index, element)` tuple.

---

## 6. Use cases

* When you need an index along with elements during iteration.
* Avoids manually incrementing counters in loops.
* Useful when you need to access elements by position and value together.
* Cleaner, more Pythonic alternative to:

  ```python
  i = 0
  for item in iterable:
      print(i, item)
      i += 1
  ```

---

## 7. Example with other iterables

Enumerate over a string:

```python
for i, char in enumerate("hello"):
    print(i, char)
```

Output:

```
0 h
1 e
2 l
3 l
4 o
```

---

## 8. Internals in CPython

* Implemented in C (`Objects/enumobject.c`).
* The enumerate object stores:

  * The current count (an integer).
  * The iterator of the iterable.
* `__next__()` method:

  * Calls `next()` on the stored iterator.
  * Returns `(current_count, element)`.
  * Increments count.

## 9. Summary Table

| Aspect         | Details                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Return type    | `enumerate` object (iterator of tuples) |
| Arguments      | iterable, start (default 0)             |
| Yielded items  | `(index, element)` tuples               |
| Index start    | User-defined integer (default 0)        |
| Iterable types | Any iterable                            |
| Laziness       | Yes (generator-like behavior)           |

---

# TL;DR

* `enumerate(iterable, start=0)` returns an iterator of `(index, element)` tuples.
* Index starts at `start` and increments by 1.
* Useful to get element positions during iteration without manual counters.
* Works lazily on any iterable.

Want me to show a **custom implementation** of `enumerate` in pure Python so you understand how it works internally?
