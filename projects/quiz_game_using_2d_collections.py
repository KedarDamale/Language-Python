# ========================================
# üß† LOGIC OF enumerate()
# ========================================
# In: for idx, val in enumerate(iterable):
# ‚Üí You get both:
#     idx ‚Üí index (0,1,2,...)
#     val ‚Üí element at that index
# Much cleaner than maintaining a counter manually.
# In Python, enumerate() is a built-in function used to loop over an iterable (like a list) and get both the index and the value at the same time.
#Syntax: enumerate(iterable, start=0)

# iterable: A sequence (like a list, string, tuple).
# start: The index to start from (default is 0).


# Without enumerate():
# i = 0
# for item in mylist:
#     print(i, item)
#     i += 1

# With enumerate():
# for i, item in enumerate(mylist):
#     print(i, item)

# - Built-in function for iteration.
# - Gives both index and element at once.
# - Prevents need for manually increasing counter.
# - Cleaner and more Pythonic.
# - Especially useful in loops where you need index + value.


# ‚úî Bonus Tip:
# Use ‚û§ tuple  ‚Üí when you only need to **search / read** (immutability helps performance)
# Use ‚û§ list   ‚Üí when you need to **modify** (Create, Read, Update, Delete ‚Äî CRUD)

# Tuples are faster than lists because they are immutable, meaning Python can optimize them better internally:

# Less memory usage
# No dynamic resizing
# No modification tracking
# Better CPU caching
